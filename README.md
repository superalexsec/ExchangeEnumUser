Do you need to enumerate users using Valid Credentials on O365 using MicrosoftOnlineExchange? You come to the right place.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

Before you start, make sure that you environment have these reqs:

* You need ExchangeOnlineManagement, but if you don't have it, my super script will check and do it for you.

## ðŸš€ Running

To run this script make sure that you`re using PowerShell as an administrator, then run it:
```
.\ExchangeEnumUser.ps1
```
> WARNING: this script makes a lot of noise, it will get all information about all of your users on Azure, be carefull. In my tests it got 20k+ users in about 10 minutes.
